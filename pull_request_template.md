### What iteration did you complete?
I finished iteration 2
### How far into the iteration you were in progress on were you? Be specific.
I was working on error handling in iteration 2. Specifically wanted to have a pop up show if no question was asked

### What was most challenging about this for you?
Getting the clear button to sit at the bottom right corner of the question/answer form.  I eventually found a way around it but I'm not happy with the way I had to do it.  I know there is a better way but I was spending too much time on it and had to move on.
